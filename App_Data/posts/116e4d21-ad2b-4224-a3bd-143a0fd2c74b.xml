  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for our next Booster meeting this Monday at 7 pm in the NRHS Media Center. We will get you updated on all the Spring Band events, including OMEA State Contest, the Band Awards Banquet, Band-A-Rama, and our Annual Basket Raffle Fundraiser. You can even reserve your spot at the 3-Spot for this fun-filled evening that benefits our Band Program! There will be plenty of food and drink, sideboards, 50/50 raffle, and fantastic baskets filled with goodies of all kinds. It's always a fun evening out and a great way to support our Bands. We are also in need of a few volunteers to help that evening, so please consider donating your time as well. &lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080c4da5ae23a6fc1-nrbb"&gt;Click on the Sign Up Genius here&lt;/a&gt; to help and as always, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
