  <content>&lt;p&gt;Well, the nice weather is upon us and it is time to start thinking about changing the closets for summer!  What a perfect time since the NRBB  ‘Fill the Truck’ for Easter Seals event is Saturday, April 23 from 9-6 by the Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So please help the marching band and Easter Seals by pulling the small, worn, torn cloth items (ANY cloth items) and bring them to the collection on Saturday, April 23rd!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thepostnewspapers.com/north_royalton/breaking_news/band-asking-residents-to-help-fill-the-truck/article_45b88593-cf9b-5f7e-8756-3245167df342.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_campaign=user-share"&gt;Here is a great article about the event&lt;/a&gt;. Share it with your friends and family and ask them to donate too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also still have a few shifts available to volunteers. If you would like to help, &lt;a href="www.signupgenius.com/go/805054eafa729a02-easter1"&gt;click here and sign up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for all you do!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
