&lt;p&gt;Congrats to all our solo and ensemble members that performed at TriC West on February 11th. FANTASTIC job… I heard so many amazing performances as I was waiting and walking through the hallways…. Always proud to represent NRHS BAND! Keep up the amazing musical work&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Munching for Music – Five Guys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munch for Music at the new Strongsville location of FIVE GUYS! Located just south of Royalton Road on the east side of Pearl Road, Five Guys is once again extending to us the opportunity to EAT for $$$$! Flyer is attached! Tell your friends, family and POST on your social media platforms. All they have to say is that they are with the North Royalton Band and we can receive up to 25% profit on their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;OPEN Chairposition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we are in need of TWO people to chair our Fruit Sale next year. I can honestly say that I have worked with Susie and Karen this year and these gals have TOTALLY organized this committee and have fantastic notes for you to follow for next year. Consider volunteering NOW since both Karen and Susie are available to go over everything with you for next year! Call Amanda Kost 440-864-6543 or Susie Perez 440-877-1299 if you are interested in volunteering. It is a FUN committee!!&lt;/p&gt;
