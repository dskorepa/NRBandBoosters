  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Band Families!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;For those that have not picked up their Band Picture Buttons, I will be in the cafeteria (by the band room) to hand out buttons THIS Wednesday night (9/7) AFTER the 6-9 practice.  Since this weekend is an away game, if you don’t pick them up on Wednesday night, you will have to wait until Friday, September 16th at the game. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please email me at dandksexton@att.net or call me at 440-785-7725.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br&gt;
Debbie Sexton&lt;/p&gt;</content>
