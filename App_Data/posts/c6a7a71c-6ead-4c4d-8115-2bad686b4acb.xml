  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the students on a job well this past weekend!  In an effort to keep everyone dry as long as possible, the students wore their raincoats as long as possible.  The raincoat retrieval process after our performance was a little difficult.  We would like students to check the pockets of the raincoat currently in their possession because some students are missing personal belongings.  Please bring these items to rehearsal on Monday.  Additionally please check the name and number of the raincoat in your possession because we need to return the raincoats to the students to whom they are assigned.  While we can wait until Friday to reshuffle the coats back to their original owners, we want to make sure that all student belongings are returned as soon as possible - so please check the pockets for items.  We appreciate your help with this process – and congratulations again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Vitale&lt;/p&gt;</content>
