  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Turn in is from &lt;b&gt;6:30pm to 8:00pm this Tuesday and Thursday&lt;/b&gt; (May 19 and 21) in the new uniform room (room 310).&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boys &lt;/b&gt;- If you are in Wind Ensemble or Symphonic Band and you haven’t taken your tux to On The Spot Dry Cleaners now is a great time to do it! You want it to be ready in time for turn in. Boys in Concert Band and Freshman band do not need to dryclean their tuxes.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Girls &lt;/b&gt;– If you haven’t washed your dress (cold water and line dry), now is a great time to do it! It needs to be dry for turn in.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seniors &lt;/b&gt;– Remember, you must return your uniform on Tuesday, May 19, in order for Mr. Vitale to sign your exit card. If you cannot return your tux or dress yourself, get a trusted friend or relative to turn it in for you.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;See you Tuesday or Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;P.S. We will also be selling our old tuxes during uniform turn in (jackets $20 and pants $10). Cash only. If you know a family member or a friend in need of a tux, pass along the dates and times so they can purchase theirs as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
