  <content>&lt;p&gt;The Disney trip is coming up fast. If your student is going, now is the time to make sure your student has everything he/she needs to march in the Disney parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your band shoes and gloves. If you need new ones you can get them from Royalton Music. However, shoes must be ordered before March 18 or you will be charged extra for shipping AND Royalton Music cannot guarantee that they will be here in time for the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to look for that white band T-shirt and some black socks too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your student has grown and you think his/her uniform may not fit, please email Anthony Amato at &lt;a href="mailto:aja@aamatolaw.com"&gt;aja@aamatolaw.com&lt;/a&gt; to set up a time to try it on and get a new one if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;mandatory Disney rehearsals on Wednesday, March 16, from 6pm to 8pm and Wednesday, March 23, from 6pm&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to 8pm&lt;/b&gt;. There is also a &lt;b&gt;mandatory rules meeting&lt;/b&gt; for students AND parents on Wednesday, March 23 from 8pm to 9pm in the PAC.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all at the Band Booster meeting this Monday (March 14) at 7pm in the media center.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
