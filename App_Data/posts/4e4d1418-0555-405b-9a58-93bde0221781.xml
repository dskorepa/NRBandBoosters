  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully everyone has been able to enjoy the Band’s video marching down Main Street U.S.A. at the Magic Kingdom in Disney World.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps, some of you were able to witness it in person also, what a memory that will last a life time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting very close to the end of our school year and with that comes the Band Banquet/Awards Evening.&amp;nbsp; This is a fun evening to celebrate your child and what he or she has accomplished over the past year.&amp;nbsp; The awards ceremony will be&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1810547068"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;Wednesday, May 2nd at 7:00 p.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but you are welcome to attend a dinner beforehand as well if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinner is catered by Brennan’s and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://northroyaltonbandboosters.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f9c4e414afe05390874757772&amp;amp;id=69fd80560f&amp;amp;e=79b990d89d" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://northroyaltonbandboosters.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Df9c4e414afe05390874757772%26id%3D69fd80560f%26e%3D79b990d89d&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1523794990750000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHDlLL7hMsxWPfUkAAYUGNjaf5e2Q"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is attached to this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Band Boosters pay for all seniors’ dinners.&amp;nbsp; Anyone else that would like to attend the dinner ranging from freshman to junior families and the families of the seniors will have to pay for their meals. The cost is $11 per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you come with an appetite and would like to eat the catered dinner doors will open at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1810547069"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;5:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;If you would like to just be a part of the band awards, please join us promptly at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1810547070"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;7:00 p.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let us know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Hospitality Committee,&lt;/p&gt;
