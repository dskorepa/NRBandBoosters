  <title>Market Day Pie Order Reminder</title>
  <description>Hi Band Families,
 
This is a reminder that the Market Day Pie orders are due by THIS Friday, Octobe</description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder that the Market Day Pie orders are due by THIS Friday, October 24, 2014 in the White Band Box. You need to prepay for these orders with either cash or a check made out to North Royalton Band Boosters. Your students can even bring their orders when they report for the football game on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick up for the pies will be Thursday, November 6, 2014 from 6:00 - 7:00 pm in Cafe #2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I have attached a copy of the order form and letter that was given to your student in case they never made it home.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Any questions, please contact Sue Galuska at suegaluska@yahoo.com or 440-582-4120.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Sue Galuska&lt;/p&gt;</content>
