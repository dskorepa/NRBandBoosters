  <content>&lt;p&gt;This is just a reminder that this is the last week to get all of your fruit orders in! All fruit orders (with payment) are due in to the white band box by this Friday, October 17th.  ASAP would be great - you don't have to wait until the last day!   We are getting close to reaching our goal!   Why not do a little last-minute brainstorming and figure out who else would love to support the band while enjoying some fresh, delicious Florida fruit! Please remember, you can also order fruit to donate to the food pantry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
