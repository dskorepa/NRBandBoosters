  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,
 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We only have a few days left before the Festival of Bands where we will get our first glimpse of our contest show:  Moonlight Reflections.  I have been watching the Wednesday night practices, and the show is amazing - an evening of entertainment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that has responded to our request for help!  We are almost there but we need of a few more volunteers to:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Usher: &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our ushers help direct the bands to their location in our stands and stop the flow of guests into the seats during each school’s performance.  This is a fun job!  You will be able to see every marching band perform.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Easter Seals: &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few spots are open to ‘man’ the truck.  Bring a book, relax and load the bags into the truck.  Shifts are short - only 1 1/2 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please consider helping us out to make this event a huge success for our hard working NRHS Marching Band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact Amanda Kost at 440-864-6543 with any of your volunteer questions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
