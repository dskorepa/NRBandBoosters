  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time to get your concert band uniform (dress or tux)! Your Marching Band Uniform MUST be turned in before picking up your concert band uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When: November 27, 2017 and November 28, 2017&lt;br&gt;Time: 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.&lt;br&gt;Where: NRHS Room 310 (Band Booster Closet/Uniform Room)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshman boys need to order a tux shirt. Cost $20. Checks made out to ‘Tuxedo Junction’. Shirts will be distributed after they are delivered. Tuxes – because we just transitioned over to new tuxes over the past few years and we need to build up our inventory. We might need to order a tux for your student. We will have a Tuxedo Junction Representative at the distribution nights to size your son. The Concert Band Uniform Committee will contact you when the ordered tux is ready for pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind Ensemble girls are required to purchase a pearl necklace and earrings (pierced and clip on available). Cost: $10. Checks made out to ‘NRHS Band Boosters’.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
