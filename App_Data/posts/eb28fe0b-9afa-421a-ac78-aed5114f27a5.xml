  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Concert Uniform Committee has added another night for pick up. It is Thursday, December 11, from 6:30pm to 7:30pm in the old uniform room. If you need to order a tux shirt (mainly freshmen), you have to go to Tuxedo Junction in Pat Catan's in Strongsville to order it. They will not be there on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
