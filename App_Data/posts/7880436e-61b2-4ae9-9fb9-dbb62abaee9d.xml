  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few years we have asked for the bags from the fruit sale be returned so we can save money by reusing them.  This is our BBYB program.  Even though we should have already asked, we would like to do the same this year.  If you still have any of your bags, please send them in with your child so they can return them to the box that will be in the band room, probably near the white band box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
