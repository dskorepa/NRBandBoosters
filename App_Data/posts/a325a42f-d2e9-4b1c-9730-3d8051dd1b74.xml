  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We still need volunteers for the Cleveland Airshow this Labor Day Weekend. It is our largest fundraiser and is even more important now that we have lost Market Day. I&lt;b&gt;f we fall short of volunteers for any of the days we will lose money from the potential $10,000 for this year, and we could possibly lose this as a fundraiser for future years&lt;/b&gt;. Please help support our band by volunteering for this event.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers just need to show up and collect/sell tickets from the general public walking or driving in to enjoy the show. We work in teams of two from 8:00am- 4:00pm. A box lunch and drinks are provided. Our volunteers must be high school age or older. &lt;b&gt;Your band students can participate! &lt;/b&gt;Please consider volunteering with family and friends while enjoying the sights and sounds of the Cleveland Air show overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="www.SignUpGenius.com/go/70A0C4DACAE29AB9-cleveland/"&gt;sign up, follow the link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about this event, please contact Becky Cozzens at &lt;a href="mailto:thecozzens@yahoo.com"&gt;thecozzens@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your support!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
