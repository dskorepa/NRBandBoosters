  <description>Dear Band Families,

I cannot thank you enough for your participation in the Cleveland National Airs</description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot thank you enough for your participation in the Cleveland National Airshow.  Although our numbers were significantly down this year, those of you who volunteered did a fantastic job and for those of you who volunteered to work two days, well, there just are no words. Your efforts are greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rough start on Saturday, you all came through on Monday in a big way.  Airshow officials have told me that Monday was the largest attended day in recent memory.  It was estimated we had well over 5000 cars come through the gate on Monday. Fortunately, we had a whopping 94 volunteers that day allowing us to easily handle the volume.  And even better, the lot was completely full by 2:30 PM and we were done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Royalton High School Marching Band is a large organization and a big operation.  Without the help of volunteers like you, our kids would not be able to enjoy the benefits of belonging to this great organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please stay involved in any way you can and again, thank you for your efforts and contribution to the kids and the marching band!

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Gary Diehl, Airshow Chairperson&lt;/p&gt;</content>
