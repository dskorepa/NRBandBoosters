  <description>Dear Band Families,

A big THANK YOU to all Band Members and Volunteers who participated in selling </description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big THANK YOU to all Band Members and Volunteers who participated in selling and helping this weekend to kick off our annual fruit sale!! We understand the date change due to the hurricane and uncertainty of the fruit supply made an already busy weekend a bit more chaotic. We very much appreciate your effort, understanding, and patience. We can’t thank you enough for still making the effort to go out and sell. We are also extremely grateful for all the volunteers that provided much-needed manpower from setting up, handing out packets, managing lines, receiving packets, plating pizza and so much more. Your active participation is what makes our band so great! Personal sale packets will be going home with band members this Wednesday after 6-9 practice. We still need the support of continued selling during this time to make the rest of the fruit sale a success. In selling during your personal sales, we suggest asking friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, elementary and middle school parents etc. Personal sales packets are due back in by October 18th. The fruit will arrive by early to mid-December. You will be notified when it arrives and the following Saturday band members will pick up their orders from the football annex and deliver fruit to their customers. We will need volunteers during this time to help organize fruit, put together orders and load into individual band member’s vehicles for them to go deliver to their customers. We will be posting a Sign Up Genius for this as the date becomes closer. Once again, we would like to thank parents, band members and volunteers who have participated and continue to participate in helping us support the North Royalton High School Marching Band. You are unique and amazing and you are making our band’s Wishes and Dreams come true!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
