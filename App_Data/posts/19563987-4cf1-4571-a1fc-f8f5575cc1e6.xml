&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Vitale has asked me to forward this message to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Vitale,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for bringing it to my attention that there was an error in the attachment of a fee to the Band and Band Front courses on the student schedules.  I have asked for that fee to be removed as I know it has already been collected as part of the Spring collection of Band fees. Sometime prior to Fee, Form and Photo day, I will ask that a new copy of corrected school fees be sent home with the students.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the confusion and any trouble it may have caused anyone.  Please feel free to forward this email on to your band parents and boosters as a way to clear up the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
