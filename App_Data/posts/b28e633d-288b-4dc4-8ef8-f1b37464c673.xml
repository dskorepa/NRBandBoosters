  <title>Pie Sale at Uniform Return Night!</title>
  <description>Hello, Band Families!
 
Remember that tonight and tomorrow night are your chances to return your ban</description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Band Families!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Remember that tonight and tomorrow night are your chances to return your bando’s marching band uniform.  As an added bonus, these are also nights when you can purchase Baker’s Square pie cards!  The actual cards will be there, ready to take home, for just $14 each.  Sweet!  These cards can then be redeemed at Baker’s Square for any pie!  Think upcoming holidays, think gifts, think about how much your family will love you if you surprise them with a tasty pie for dessert, just because!  Order sheets are on the booster website to have cards sent home with your band member, but why not pick up a few when you are at the school for uniform drop-off anyway?  Look for them!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;</content>
