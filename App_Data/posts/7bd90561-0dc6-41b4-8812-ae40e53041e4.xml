  <content>&lt;p&gt;We love band, yes we du. We love band, how 'bout you? If you're shouting "Yes!" right now, then you qualify for our next Munching For Music day at Chick-fil-A! Next Wednesday, April 20th, from 6:30 am - 10:00 pm, how 'bout you? If you're shouting "Yes!" right now, then you qualify for our next Munching For Music day at Chick-fil-A! Next Wednesday, April 20th, from 6:30 am - 10:00 pm, at the Chick-fil-A located at 16584 Royalton Road in Strongsville is the place to be! Yes, you read that right...this is an all-day event! They call it a Spirit Day, so let's show them how much band spirit we have by eating a lot of Chick-fil-A that day! You can literally eat there for breakfast, lunch and dinner if that's what you choose to do. We will just appreciate any support you can give. When you visit the restaurant, please bring a paper copy of &lt;a href="/FILES%2f2016%2f04%2fChickFilA-SpiritRally-April+20.pdf.axdx"&gt;the flyer&lt;/a&gt; with you, or just show it on your phone. We know how popular Chick-fil-A sandwiches always are at different Royalton events, so now you can enjoy anything from their restaurant while helping the band earn some moo-lah. Let's have a great Spirit Day by supporting a generous business as they give support back to us.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
