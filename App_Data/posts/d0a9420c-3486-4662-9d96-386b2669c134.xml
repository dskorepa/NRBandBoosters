&lt;p&gt;Come see the final band performance for the 2013-2014 season. All bands will be performing in the High School Gym.

The bands will also be honoring the men and women of our armed services with a special medley of songs, so make sure to invite any family and friends that have served our country so they can be recognized and honored.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
