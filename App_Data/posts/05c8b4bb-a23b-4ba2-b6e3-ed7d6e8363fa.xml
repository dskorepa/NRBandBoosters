  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the end of school and band functions for the year, we&amp;nbsp; are hosting the OMEA State Band Event on April 20-21 including approximately 25 Bands. Concessions will be available in Cafe 2 for all bands, families and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this fundraiser to be a continued success benefiting our kids and this great band program, we are asking each Senior family to please donate 1 to 2 packages of snack items. Due to district food preparation rules, these items need to be store bought and individually packaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items that would be appreciated include Cheese Its, Little Debbie items like Nutty Bars, Oatmeal pies, as well as Hostess cupcakes, mini muffins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be greatly appreciated if you would please bring your donation to 4851 Persimmon Lane starting April 10 and no later than April 17 placing them in the container on the porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any questions I can be reached via call or text 216-990-0271 or &lt;a href="mailto:dawnrembowski@att.net" target="_blank"&gt;dawnrembowski@att.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your donation and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Smiling,&lt;br&gt;Dawn Rembowski&lt;/p&gt;</content>
