  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families, &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Committee for North Royalton Schools Future needs your help!  They are looking for at least 150 volunteers to go Door-to-door anytime from Oct. 5th-11th to talk with community members about the bond.  They are targeting homes with registered voters who are supportive of the bond. You can go anytime during the week, whatever works for your schedule.  The minimum time commitment is 2 hours.   They would like to have sign ups completed by Sept. 26th.  Please consider volunteering your time on this very important issue. &lt;/p&gt;
