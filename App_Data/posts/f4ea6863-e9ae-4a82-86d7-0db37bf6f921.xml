  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In November and December we will be eating Bakers Square pies for Munching for Music! Starting at tonight’s Marching Band Concert we will be selling Bakers Square pie certificates for $14 each. &lt;a href="/FILES%2f2015%2f11%2fPieSaleOrderForm-2015.pdf.axdx"&gt;Order forms&lt;/a&gt; will also be coming home with students soon. It’s easy! Buy/sell certificates and then go to Bakers Square to turn them in for fresh baked pies. Bakers Square is located at 7011 W. 130thSt, Parma Hts., OH. You can turn your order in as soon as you want. The sooner you turn it in, the sooner you receive your certificates. All orders are due by December 15. Sell to your friends, family, co-workers, etc. This is a great idea for desserts for the upcoming holidays. You can also donate certificates to the North Royalton Food Bank. The &lt;a href="/FILES%2f2015%2f11%2fPieSaleLetter-2015.pdf.axdx"&gt;flyer&lt;/a&gt; and order form are attached for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/FILES%2f2015%2f11%2fPieSaleOrderForm-2015.pdf.axdx" class="cta-purple buzz-out"&gt;Pie Sale Order Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for supporting our band!&lt;/p&gt;
