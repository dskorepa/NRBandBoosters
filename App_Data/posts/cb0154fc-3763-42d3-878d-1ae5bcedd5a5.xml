  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the many new band parents that signup up last night to volunteer at the Cleveland Air Show this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are well on our way to filling our quota of volunteers, but we are not there yet – especially for Monday.  We need a total of 85 people each of the three days at the airshow to fill our quota.  We are paid per volunteer, so the more volunteers we have the more we can raise for the band.
For those of you who are not aware, this is a marching band trip year where almost 300 Bandos spend a week at Disney and march in the parade there.  It is an awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money raised at the air show is earmarked to offset the cost of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your son or daughter is planning on participating in the Disney trip this year, volunteering a few hours of your time would be much-appreciated contribution toward this great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080944a5ae2fa4ff2-20172"&gt;You can sign up online here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank You,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Diehl
Air Show Committee Chairman&lt;/p&gt;</content>
