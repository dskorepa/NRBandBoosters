  <content>&lt;h3&gt;Concessions Help Is Needed!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Senior Band Night coming up this week Friday, we are in need of more volunteers than usual to help with concessions. (10 to be exact). If you are available, please contact Dawn Rembowski at 216-990-0271 or email her at &lt;a href="mailto:dawnrembowski@att.net"&gt;dawnrembowski@att.net&lt;/a&gt;. The side bonus to volunteering this week is the fact that you get to stay warm and dry and won't be missing our kids perform. (The show begins after the game this week.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hand Warmers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since several of our parents will be tied up with Senior Band Night, we are looking for a few new recruits willing to sell hand warmers at the booster table at the game on Friday.  If you are available, please contact Holly Michalke at 216-926-8836.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Holly&lt;/p&gt;
