  <content>&lt;p&gt;The Band Boosters have recently learned that Easter Seals has transferred the part of their organization that does the ‘Fill The Truck' drives to Savers, a global thrift retailer. Savers is an organization that helps more than 120 nonprofit organizations by paying them for donated goods. &lt;b&gt;Your donations are a donation to the North Royalton Band Boosters and are still tax deductible.&lt;/b&gt; We will have a charitable tax deduction form for you for tax purposes. We will receive funds based on the weight of what we collect as we have in the past. We will be collecting soft good items (clothing, shoes, purses, blankets, towels, table cloths, etc.) next to the Board of Education (6579 Royalton Road) on Friday (4-9pm), Saturday (10 – 8pm) and Sunday (12 – 6pm).
