  <content>&lt;p&gt;Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on the homestretch to the end of the school year and the Band Awards Banquet is fast approaching. &lt;a href="/FILES%2f2017%2f04%2fBandAwardsDinnerInvitation-2017.pdf.axdx"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download the invitation and RSVP form.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (The RSVP is the second page of the document.) RSVP’s are due back on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A check is needed to pay for everyone attending who is not a Senior Band Student. The cost is $11 per person. Seniors band members are free. Please put the RSVP and payment in an envelope and mark it, “Awards Banquet Night” and have your student drop it off in the white band box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you do not attend the dinner, everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend the Band Awards program which starts at 7:00pm. It is a great way to spend an enjoyable evening with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see everyone there!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;br&gt;Hospitality&lt;/p&gt;</content>
