  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Junior Band Families, &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;Friday, October 16, 2015,&lt;/b&gt; we will be honoring the senior band members.  Dinner for them and their immediate family will be served at 5:30PM, right after practice and before the game.  The rest of the band will enjoy pizza, bakery and beverages. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are asking all Junior Band Families to bring store bought desserts with NO peanuts to this event. &lt;/b&gt; Please send your dessert with your band student and have them drop it off in Cafeteria II before they go to practice.  Please put your last name on the dessert.  NO dessert should be dropped off in the band room.  Someone will be in Cafeteria II to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/409044daeab2da20-bakery"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please sign up for a specific dessert here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact me at alandhelenkelly@cox.net or (440) 746-9048. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;br&gt;
Hospitality Committee &lt;/p&gt;</content>
