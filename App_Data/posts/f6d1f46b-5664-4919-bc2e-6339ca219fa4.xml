  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a follow up to our email titled: ‘Today’s News’, the Boosters would like to extend a HUGE THANK YOU to all the bandos, their families and friends that stepped up to help us out on Sunday and Monday! We had a record turnout of volunteers!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you had a fantastic time, watched the Air Show and were able to meet other band families in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you have any pictures you would like to share, please post them to the North Royalton Band Booster website…. We would love to see them!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your week and see you at our first HOME football game this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Kost&lt;br&gt;President&lt;/p&gt;</content>
