  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that my last email had a link for Air Show SignUp that works for some people but not for others. My apologies. Below is a link that should work for all.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please go home this weekend and look at your plans for September 6 &amp;amp; 7. While we did get a few new volunteers at last night’s Parent Mixer (Thank You!) we still need more. We are still about 10 people short on Sunday and 50 people short on Monday. We will not get paid for unfilled spots, and because we are so short we could lose this fundraiser next year. If there is any way you can volunteer on those days please sign up now.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0c4dacae29ab9-cleveland/"&gt;Sign Up for Air Show Here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Becky Humes&lt;br&gt;Band Booster Corresponding Secretary&lt;/p&gt;</content>
