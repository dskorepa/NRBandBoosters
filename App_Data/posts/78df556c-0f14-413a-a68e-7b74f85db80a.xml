  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now taking orders for Contest Hoodies and Pins! All orders are due by September 9, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have attached the order form for your convenience. Please complete the form and return it with your payment in an envelope labeled “Contest Hoodie” by September 9, 2015. Your student can place it in the white metal box in the band room. You can also turn it in at our next Band Booster meeting on August 31 at 7pm in the High School Community Room. We will not take late orders for Contest Hoodies, and we will not be ordering extras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/FILES%2f2015%2f08%2f2015ContestHoodieOrderForm.pdf.axdx" class="cta-purple buzz-out"&gt;2015 Contest Hoodie Order Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to point out that if you join Band Boosters at the Grand Staff level you will receive a Contest Hoodie as part of your membership. The Grand Staff level of membership is only available through September 9. Other levels of membership will continue to be available after that date. We have also &lt;a href="http://www.northroyaltonbandboosters.com/FILES%2f2015%2f08%2fNRHS-BandBoosterMembership2015-2016.pdf.axdx"&gt;attached the membership form&lt;/a&gt; for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please call Shirley Berish with any questions (440) 717-1532.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becky Humes &lt;br&gt;Band Booster Corresponding Secretary&lt;/p&gt;</content>
