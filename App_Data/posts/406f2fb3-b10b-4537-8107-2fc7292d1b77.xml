  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The response for the Band Treat bags has been amazing! Our band has very supportive parents and I am so happy to be in a group of such great people.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would easily fill the small treat bags I had envisioned and then the candy just kept flowing in. Now we are in need of filling bigger bags and so now I’m in need of help J. I will start working on the bags at noon tomorrow (Thursday). If anyone would like to join me in candy land :) that would be great. See address below.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
