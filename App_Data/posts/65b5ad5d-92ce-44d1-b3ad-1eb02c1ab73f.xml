  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Post would like a picture of the band at State Finals to put in their newspaper&lt;/b&gt;. We are looking for good pictures of the band, preferably of a higher quality/megapixel. I think they may also consider pictures from one of the other contests if you don’t have one from the State Finals. If you are sending one of those please note which contest it is from.  We need the picture as soon as possible. If you have one please email it to us at northroyaltonbandboosters@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are still some tickets available for the Taste of North Royalton&lt;/b&gt;. It is this Thursday, November 6, at St. Paul's Hellenic Center and it goes from 5:30 to 8:30 pm. It will be a fun evening of food, drinks and wonderful raffle baskets. The event is co-sponsored by the North Royalton Stadium Foundation and the North Royalton Educational Foundation. The cost is $30 per person. If you are interested in attending, please email Jim Smith at jls8141@gmail.com and he will work with you on getting tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
