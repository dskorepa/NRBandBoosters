&lt;p&gt;The Band registrations for next year were due by March 24 (except for Band Front) and while most have successfully submitted their online Registrations, we still have a number of missing registrations, measurement, and volunteer forms that are now late. Please submit the forms as soon as you can. We require the following 3 forms to be filled out and submitted for every band student:&lt;/p&gt;
[more]
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Band Registration (use credit card or paypal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Measurement Forms (for uniforms) [Boys] [Girls]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Volunteer Form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If your student will be a Royalaire or Royalette and does NOT play an instrument during concert season, use the Band Front Registration form, which is now available.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
