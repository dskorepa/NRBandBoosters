  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We need your help! We still have &lt;strong&gt;30 spots to fill at the Cleveland Airshow&lt;/strong&gt; (August 30-September 1).  Most of the open spots are on Monday, 9/1, but we have a few on Saturday and Sunday as well.  If we cannot fill these spots we will lose some of the fundraising money for this year and we could possibly lose this fundraiser for next year.  Please make time in your schedule to fill these spots. Volunteers must be at least 15 years old or be an incoming freshman.  Volunteers may be other family members or friends!  If you can help, please contact Kathy Pishnery at &lt;a href="tel:440-503-5457"&gt;440-503-5457&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:kathypish@aol.com"&gt;kathypish@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h4&gt;For families that have already volunteered:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help!! Air show information and parking passes were sent home this week with your band student if you were unable to pick them up on Preview night or at the first Booster meeting - so be sure to look for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
