&lt;p&gt;Hello, Band Families!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We hope you are enjoying your summer break! We would like to tell you about a fundraiser that will be taking place next week. This will be one of our Munching for Music days. Many of you know how these work, but for all of you new band families, let us explain. Munching for Music events are specific days and/or times that we partner with nearby restaurants to help raise funds for our band. On a certain day, we encourage everyone to visit the participating restaurant, make a purchase and let the cashier know you are there to benefit the Band Boosters. That's it - how simple! You get an excuse to eat out and the band receives some much-needed funds. It's a win-win for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;b&gt;Tuesday, June14, &lt;/b&gt;will be our Munching for Music kick-off event for the 2016-2017 school year. It will take place at Dairy Queen, located at 12980 W Sprague Rd in Parma. Just take in a copy of the flyer, show it on your phone or simply mention you are there to help us, and we will receive 20% of your purchase. This is an all-day event and the hours are 10am - 10pm, so feel free to stop in multiple times that day! Every little bit will help, whether you get a small cone, a sandwich or even a big ice cream cake! What a great way to celebrate the beginning of marching band practices!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Munching for Music events will take place throughout the year, at various restaurants, so get ready to enjoy some good eats for a great cause! Thank you for supporting the North Royalton Marching Band!&lt;/p&gt;
