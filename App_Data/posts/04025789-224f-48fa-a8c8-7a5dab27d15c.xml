  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;As our Easter Seals event draws closer, we are working harder than ever to spread the word about this event. If you happen to visit, or know someone that is involved with a garage sale, rummage sale, street sale, moving sale, flea market or yard sale, kindly let the seller know that after their sale, they can donate their unsold &lt;b&gt;SOFT GOOD&lt;/b&gt; items to our Easter Seals event (NR Home Days) on &lt;b&gt;Sat/Sun August 20-21&lt;/b&gt; next to the board office. We also have a location to drop off items ahead of time if this time is inconvenient!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.SignUpGenius.com/go/805054EAFA729A02-easter2"&gt;follow this link to volunteer your time!&lt;/a&gt; It is an easy and extremely helpful way to show your support!
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Any questions?&lt;/p&gt;
