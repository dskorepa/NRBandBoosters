  <content>&lt;p&gt;Band parents,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Just a reminder to please get your ticket orders in ASAP.  The concerts are quickly filling up.  Reminder that all seating for all three concerts are RESERVED seats and need to be purchased in advance.  Our ticket committee is working very hard to fill orders, and orders will be filled in the order they are received.  The last day to pre-purchase tickets is Thursday 12/11.  After that point, no ticket orders will be filled.  This is so the ticket committee can return the tickets to the students on Friday 12/12.  In the past, these concerts have typically sold out.  While any remaining tickets will be sold at the door at the “will call” table, it is very likely that the concerts would be sold out at this point.  Please plan ahead to avoid this frustration on the day of the concerts.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Also, please verify what concert your student is performing in - not all students perform at each concert - each one is different.  All details have been posted on the Band Website, including the student Itinerary and Info-sheet for the performances.  Thank you and we look forward to seeing everyone at our Holiday Concerts!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;-Mr. V.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
