  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Freshman Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;Friday, October 16, 2015&lt;/b&gt;, we will be honoring the senior band members. Dinner for them and their immediate family will be served at 5:30PM, right after practice and before the game. The rest of the band will enjoy pizza, bakery and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are asking all Freshmen Band Families to bring beverages to this event.&lt;/b&gt; The drinks can be dropped off at Cafeteria II beginning at 3:30PM on Friday, October 16, 2015, or your band student can drop off the drinks before they go to practice. Please put your last name on the drinks so we know who dropped off the beverages. Someone will be in Cafeteria II to accept your donation. NO beverages should be dropped off in the band room.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/409044daeab2da20-drink"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please sign up for a specific beverage type here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please contact me at alandhelenkelly@cox.net or (440) 746-9048 if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;br&gt;Hospitality Committee&lt;/p&gt;</content>
