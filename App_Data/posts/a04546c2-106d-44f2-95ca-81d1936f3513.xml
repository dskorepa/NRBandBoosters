  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all the band members that sold and returned their first two raffle tickets by September 15th, a winner of the 2017 Contest Hoodie has been chosen. (Thank you, Amanda, for drawing the winning ticket at the Boosters meeting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The winner is – &lt;b&gt;Raymond Perez&lt;/b&gt;!!! Congratulations Raymond, enjoy your hoodie!&lt;/h3&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;FYI - The Copley H.S. Marching Band sells Good Luck Notes that appear in the program book that they sell at their Invitational which our band will be attending Saturday, October 14, 2017. If you would like to add a Good Luck Note for your favorite Band Member, or Section, or Director to the Copley Invitational’s Program book, click here. I know it says to email it, but you can mail it, with payment, to the address at the bottom. Please note that they need to receive it by October 6th.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
