  <content>&lt;h4&gt;North Royalton High School Band Boosters is Sponsoring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Another Easter Seals ‘Fill The Truck’ Fundraiser&lt;/h3&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, September 19, from 9am to 8pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next to the North Royalton Board of Education, 6579 Royalton Road&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Our first fundraiser was a HUGE SUCCESS! We collected 12,000 pounds of clothing and other cloth items! WOW!!! We also had so many people tell us they wish they had known earlier that we added another date.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we will be collecting any and all cloth items to benefit both the band and our community. Acceptable items include (but are not limited to): clothing, comforters, blankets, towels, sheets, shoes, accessories, and purses. The Boosters will only earn money from those types of cloth donations listed above. Even stained or torn items can be recycled into something else.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Tell your friends and neighbors! You do not need to have a student at North Royalton to donate items. All donors will receive a tax deductible receipt! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Amanda Kost at &lt;a href="mailto:amandabethkost@gmail.com"&gt;amandabethkost@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; or at 440-864-6543.&lt;/p&gt;
