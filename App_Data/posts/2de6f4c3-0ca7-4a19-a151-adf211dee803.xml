  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Now that the school year has begun we want to celebrate with a big Munching for Music month in September! Last June’s munching day at Sweet CeCe's was very successful so we are having another one there on September 2nd. This is an early release day so we will all have more time to enjoy some yummy food and frozen yogurt at Sweet CeCe's! Just print off the attached flyer and present it when you order, or you can also show it on your smart phone. 20% of all sales will then be donated to the band. Another Munching for Music day is also being planned for mid-September. Please keep watching your email for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
