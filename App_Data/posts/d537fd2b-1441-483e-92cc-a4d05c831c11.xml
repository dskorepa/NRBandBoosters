  <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dates for Concert Uniform Pick-Up are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, December 2nd, 6:00pm - 8:00pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday, December 3rd, 6:00pm - 8:00pm&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick-up location is in the OLD UNIFORM ROOM&lt;/b&gt;, where you picked up your marching uniform (upstairs over cafeteria 2). All pieces of your marching uniform must be returned before you can pick up your concert uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Boys who need a tux shirt (mainly freshman) will be able to order them from Tuxedo Junction. There will be someone available both evenings to measure you and take your order. &lt;b&gt;The cost of the shirts is $22.50&lt;/b&gt;. Shirts can also be ordered at Tuxedo Junction located in PatCatan's. Just mention that you are with NRHS.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Girls who are new to Wind Ensemble will need to purchase a pearl necklace and earrings from us. &lt;b&gt;Cost is $10&lt;/b&gt;. They will be available for purchase when you pick up your uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
