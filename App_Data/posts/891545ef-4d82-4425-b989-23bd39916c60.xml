  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;It’s just a little over a week until band camp starts! Where has the time gone? The anticipation of the upcoming season is building. It is always fun to imagine what creation will unfold for the contest show! As always, I am looking forward to the announcement! Be sure to look at your band calendar often and visit Mr. Vitale’s site to be sure you are on top of all the rehearsal times, uniform distribution and performances. It can come at you pretty fast! &lt;a href="http://www.northroyaltonhighschoolband.com"&gt;Here is the link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Loss of Market Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few changes that have occurred over the summer that will affect our boosters moving forward. Most importantly is the loss of Market Day. This equates to a yearly cut of about $8,000 to our fundraising budget. Market Day has ceased the program entirely. Because of this loss, we need to be sure we make up the difference in other areas, as well as maintaining and maximizing our current fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Air Show Fundraiser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest fundraiser will be the Cleveland Airshow Labor Day weekend (Sept. 5-7). This event is our biggest money maker and requires no selling. We are responsible for parking cars and collecting ticket money. That’s it! But, we need 80 people per day or we will not make the full $10,000. Please consider saving a spot during your Labor Day Weekend to help with this event. &lt;a href="www.SignUpGenius.com/go/70A0C4DACAE29AB9-cleveland/"&gt;Please follow this link to sign up&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Parents and students (high school age or older) are welcome to volunteer! So, please sign your bando up (as long as you join them). Friends and other family members are welcome as well. Just be sure to change the quantity to the number of people you are signing up and list their names in the box. It’s easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We realize this event takes place over Labor Day weekend, but making nearly 1/3 of our budget by simply volunteering 9 hours of your day is far better than selling another product. Thank you to the many that have already signed up! Please consider joining us! It’s easy work and can be a lot of fun! If you would like to know more about this event, please contact Becky Cozzens at &lt;a href="mailto:thecozzens@yahoo.com"&gt;thecozzens@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Easter Seals Fundraiser - Help Us Fill The Truck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for our “Fill the Truck” event on August 22nd and August 23rd! North Royalton Band Boosters will partner with Easter Seals Northern Ohio to not only raise money for the North Royalton Marching Band, but also to help local children and adults with disabilities. ANYONE can donate. An Easter Seals truck will be parked west of the North Royalton Board of Education at 6579 Royalton Road to accept donations of clothing, blankets, towels, shoes, purses, stuffed animals, cloth lunchboxes and backpacks, etc. Even stained items can be recycled into something! The more items we donate, the more money we will raise! (*All donations are tax deductible and you will receive a receipt when you drop off your items). Our goal is to collect over 1,500 large bags of clothing and raise $3,500 to support our North Royalton Marching Band. We challenge every student to fill a bag with cloth items and return it to the event to support our fundraiser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Parent Mixer - August 13&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Mark your calendars!!! WE’D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU! (This is our first event!)&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Some Band Boosters members will be relaxing at The 3 Spot on Thursday, August 13 from 6-9 pm. This event takes place during our kids’ rehearsal. We figured you could drop your band student off at the high school and come join us for some fun, food and spirits while our kids are hard at work! Band Spirit Wear and membership information will be available at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;See you on August 13!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holly Michalke&lt;br&gt;Band Booster President&lt;/p&gt;</content>
