  <title>Freshman &amp; Sophomore Boys Need to Get Measured for New Tuxes</title>
  <description>Dear Freshman and Sophomore Band Families:
 
Freshman and sophomore BOYS only will need to be fitted</description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Freshman and Sophomore Band Families:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freshman and sophomore BOYS only will need to be fitted for their concert uniform.&lt;/b&gt; Tuxedo Junction will be at the HS the same dates as uniform turn in &lt;b&gt;(Nov. 17 and Nov. 18 from 6pm to 8pm)&lt;/b&gt;. Once you turn in your marching uniform, please be sure to meet with the concert uniform staff to be measured.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Freshmen boys will also need to purchase a white dress shirt that evening. Please bring a check for $21 payable to Tuxedo Junction.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you have a conflict, please contact one of the concert uniform staff ASAP. Uniforms need to be ordered at that time to ensure they arrive by the first concert in December.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
