  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Parents,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Our bandos AND their uniforms have taken a beating from the weather recently. Please remember the football pants and raincoats can be washed on gentle and cold, and air dried.  It would be a good week to have the jacket and contest pants dry cleaned so the pants look sharp for states.  Sorry, but this would be at your expense.  At the very least, spot clean the pants.  If there is mud on them wait til it dries and then brush with stiff brush.  Use a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue as well as nacho cheese, etc.  Also, take a damp cloth to the hats and clean and polish shoes. Thanks for taking care of the uniforms!!&lt;/p&gt;
