  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;It's a new Band season and the pit crew is looking for some new volunteers. Last year we lost three parents, and they need to be replaced. Pit duties are pretty easy. We load the big purple band truck (Barney) with most of the students’ instruments. We then unload at the games/contests and help push the pit equipment into place for the performance. After the game/contest we reload Barney and return to the school to unload. We have lots of fun! We watch the band and games at field level, and there’s usually some sort of food each week. We arrive about 30 minutes before the truck load time (usually 5:30-6:00) and travel in carpools to the games and contests. It's a lot of fun and you get to watch a lot of the band inner workings. Ladies don't be afraid. We currently have two in this year’s pit crew. If you are interested you can email me at &lt;a href="mailto:hrinmor@sbcglobal.net"&gt;hrinmor@sbcglobal.net&lt;/a&gt; or call for more info at 440-668-7428&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Rich Hrin&lt;br&gt;Pit Crew Chair&lt;/p&gt;</content>
