  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Junior Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;WE NEED YOUR HELP!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, October 7, 2016, we will be honoring the senior band members. Dinner for them and their immediate family will be served at 5:15PM, right after practice and before the game. We are hoping the rest of the band will enjoy pizza, bakery and beverages, but CURRENTLY LESS THAN HALF THE JUNIOR BAND FAMILIES HAVE SIGNED UP TO DONATE and there will not be enough bakery for the Juniors, Sophomores and Freshmen.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We are asking all Junior Band Families to bring store bought desserts with NO peanuts to this event. Please send your dessert with your band student and have them drop it off in Cafeteria II before they go to practice. Please put your last name on the dessert. NO dessert should be dropped off in the band room. Someone will be in Cafeteria II to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/409044DAEAB2DA20-senior2"&gt;Please sign up for a dessert here&lt;/a&gt;. Any store bought bakery or cookies (with NO peanuts) would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact me at alandhelenkelly@cox.net or (440) 746-9048.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Helen&lt;br&gt;Hospitality Committee&lt;/p&gt;</content>
