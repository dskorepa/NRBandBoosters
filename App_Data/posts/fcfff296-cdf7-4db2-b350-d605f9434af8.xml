  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;

       &lt;p&gt;It's time again for Seniors to apply for local Scholarships. The deadline for Scholarship applications is this Friday, January 27th. If your senior has not yet applied, they can log into their NRAPPS account to find all the information.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;We are looking for 3 Freshman, Sophomore or Junior parents to read through the essays and select from the applications submitted. Please reply to this email or call Regina Atkinson at (440)227-1687 if you are interested in helping. This is an interesting and easy way to help out and hear directly from our Band Seniors what the program has meant to them. Thank you as always for your support!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
