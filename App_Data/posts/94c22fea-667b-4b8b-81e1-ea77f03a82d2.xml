  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Help support the NR Band Boosters by purchasing a photo button of your child from the Band Boosters. Pictures for the buttons will be taken on picture day after the group pictures are taken. Each band member will get their picture taken (kids can also pose with friends/siblings too) and these will be available as buttons. The cost of each button is $5.00 and all proceeds support the Band Boosters. (Note: don’t order the photo button on the picture order form – this is not the Band Boosters button).&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Button orders will be taken on August 16 at Parent Preview Night (a table will be set up at the stadium starting at 6 pm where you can view the pictures, order and pay for your buttons). You can also order your buttons at the first Band Boosters meeting on August 31. Buttons will be available for pick up at the first home game on September 11, beginning at 6 pm until halftime (a table will be set up at the stadium). Additional dates to order and pick up buttons will be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We still need volunteers for Picture Day - if you can help out with the button pictures, we need a few more people to help from 7:45 am – 10:30 at the stadium. We need picture takers and people to help organize the lines. If you are available, please contact Nancy Chester at &lt;a href="mailto:n.chester@sbcglobal.net"&gt;n.chester@sbcglobal.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
