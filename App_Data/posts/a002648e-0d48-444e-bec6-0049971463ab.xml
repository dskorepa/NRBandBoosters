  <title>We need help on Senior Band Night</title>
  <description>Dear Band Families,
 
We only have a few weeks before we will be honoring the senior band members.  </description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Dear Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We only have a few weeks before we will be honoring the senior band members.  On Friday, October 16, 2015, dinner for them and their immediate family will be served at 5:30PM, right after practice and before the football game.  The rest of the band will enjoy pizza, bakery and beverages.  Obviously we need a few volunteers to help make sure this event goes smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that has already responded to our request for help!  We are almost there but we need of a few more volunteers. &lt;a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/409044DAEAB2DA20-senior"&gt;Please view the Signup Genius link&lt;/a&gt; and if you could help out it would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Helen Kelly&lt;br&gt;
Hospitality&lt;/p&gt;</content>
