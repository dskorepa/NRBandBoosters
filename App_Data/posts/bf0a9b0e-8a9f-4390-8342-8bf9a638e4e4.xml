  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello Fellow Band Parents,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;It is time to plan for our next major fundraiser! We will be hosting State Band Contest on Friday, April 22 (3:30-11:30 pm) and Saturday, April 23 (7:30-11:30 am). This event is similar to what you saw at Westlake in February.  It takes roughly 100 volunteers to support this event! It is another significant fundraiser for the Band Boosters and will be successful because of our parent volunteers!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;All band students will be assigned a job by Mr. Vitale to help with hosting this event. Please consider joining us for a 3 hour (or more) position of your choice. It's a great way to be with friends, show your NORO pride and help out the band! The jobs are simple, and we can assure you that, due to the flexibility of the schedule, you will get to see your student perform.&lt;/p&gt;
