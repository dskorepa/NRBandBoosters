  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hola, Band Families!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Another Munching For Music day is set! This time we're doing it Mexican style! On Wednesday, March 9th, please help support our band by visiting the Chipotle Mexican Grill, at 4416 Royalton Road in Brecksville. This is the newer restaurant over by I-77, across the street from Giant Eagle and GetGo. You can help by stopping in between the hours of 5 and 8:30 pm, presenting a paper copy of our flyer, showing it on your smartphone or simply telling the cashier you would like your purchase to support the North Royalton Band Boosters. No hay problema, ¿verdad? We've always had great turnouts for our munching days, so please consider telling everyone you know to help us out this time too!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;íMuchas Gracias!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/FILES%2f2016%2f02%2fchipotle-flyer.pdf.axdx"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download Chipotle Flyer.pdf (601.9KB)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>
