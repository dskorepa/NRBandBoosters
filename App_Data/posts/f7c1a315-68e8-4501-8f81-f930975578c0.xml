  <description>Hi Band Families,
 
The LAST day to get your uniform before Picture Day is Monday 4pm-8pm in room 31</description>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Band Families,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The LAST day to get your uniform before Picture Day is Monday 4pm-8pm in room 310.  You must be in uniform to be in the picture.  If you have any questions or problems please contact Anthony Amato at 216-401-7763 &lt;a href="mailto:oraja@aamatolaw.com"&gt;oraja@aamatolaw.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We would also remind everyone to have patience with the uniform committee. Fitting students takes time. This is especially true for freshmen who have to try on all the different parts of the uniform and let the uniform volunteers make sure it fits properly. Sometimes they have to try on multiple sizes before finding the “best fit.” We appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
